# Tech-Blog

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a blog site, allowing logged in users to create, edit delete and comment on posts hosted in the SQL database.  Passwords are encrypted for user safety, and one must sign up if they wish to interact with the site.  It was painfully similar to the second project that was assigned THE SAME WEEK THIS WAS, but I'm not bitter.

## Installation
Once the github has been cloned, the following technologies are required using 'npm install':
- express
- nodemon

Other technologies required are Sequelize, Node.js and Insomnia.  

Finally, technologies used to create the project include Bootstrap CSS, BCrypt, and Heroku, which was used to publish the website.


## Usage
When someone follows the link to the site, they are shown the home page, created with handlebars.  If the user wishes to sign up, they must hit the login button, then hit the sign up button.  After following the prompts to create an account, they can begin creating posts.  Click the new post, assign the post a title and text content, then the user is redirected to the home page with the new post on the site.  If the user wants to see their posts, they may go to the dashboard button in the header.  If they click on a post, they have the option to comment, which will be saved as well.  Because of cookie integration, the site will remember usernames and passwords.
